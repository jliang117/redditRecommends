Eowyn27,"So this is an odd story but I went to Ippudo few years ago and I was very disappointed. It was a long wait and I felt the Ramen wasn't that special. I really liked their sake drinks though and apps. I recently went to Ippudo again with a group and it was the BEST Ramen I ever had! Maybe it depends on what you order but I had the Ramen with the burnt garlic and there was so much explosive flavor in there, it was amazing. 

Funnily enough, I tried Ivan's Ramen a few weeks and later, I would have to say, avoid at all costs. Ivan's terribly overrated. 

Go for Ippudo and Totto Ramen is good too!

Momofuku Noodle - Always a solid choice, not the best in the city though. 

Naruto - If you're close to the UES, a really good neighborhood spot.

Zombee_Brett,"Just to give you another opinion on the places being named;

Totally agree with EndiMoon on Ramen-Ya, they have my favorite broth and I love their chashu.

Even though I hear it a lot, I do not think Ippudo is overrated. Good broth and great al dente noodles (I usually get their classic tonkotsu with nitamago egg and shigureni (pulled pork).  Also their pork buns are amazing.  It is expensive and the wait is crazy.  If you go, go before you are hungry, leave your phone number, and find something nearby to do for the up-to-three-hour wait that happens.

Nakamura is a cool tiny spot with great ramen.  Love their Ajitama eggs.

Ivan Ramen is a cool, unique spot with pretty good ramen and a Jewish spin on Japanese food.  The rye noodles are good, and I like a lot of their small non-ramen plates as well.

Totto is very popular, good ramen but not my personal favorite.

Some other spots to consider - 
Ramen Lab is a very tiny, but cool place that hosts ramen chefs from around the world for a few weeks at a time.  Just check the website to see who is there while you are in town.  
For a low key but good place to get a quick bowl, I like Minca Ramen (they also have a sister restaurant Kambi, which I haven't tried.)  
I also like David Chang's Momofuku Noodle Shop, but more for his food other than the ramen.

Also if you plan to travel outside of Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens have some shops worth checking out.

EndiMoon,Ramen Ya remains the best ramen that I've had in New York. A lot of the hyped up places (see: Ippudo) are a letdown and definitely not worth the wait or the price. Ramen Ya's broth is always on point and they have the best chashu hands down. ,1515877952.0,/r/ramen/comments/7q5wyv/best_ramen_nyc/dsmvdk6/,ramen

IlezAji,"For Dim Sum it really depends on if Flushing will be out of the way for you, Manhattan - Chinatown's Dim Sum offerings are still good but the ones out in Flushing are going to be a bit better. I'll give you some recommendations for both though; for Flushing I usually go with Asian Jewels or Jade, in Manhattan my personal choice is Golden Unicorn but there's also some merit to the cult Jing Fong's got behind it.

Honestly unless you come really early or really late expect to wait around an hour to an hour and a half for peak dim sum times, if you wind up waiting less than that then huzzah.

They put on the whole show.  everyone shouts at you in japanese when you first walk in.  The staff all seem happy and into it.  They have a great variety of broths and noodles.  They make their own noodles which is rareish.  They have some amazing special ramens from time to time.  They have a bar.  My recommendation is, go at around 6pm, it's easily worth the hour wait if you stand by the bar and get a bottle of sake and a plate of shishitos.

Other ramen restaurants I like include Minca, Hide-chan (owned by the same people who own Totto, but this place specializes in pork broth), Momofuku (really started this ramen craze, but I wouldn't say it's the best), Ivan (fairly new, has some less traditional styles), Chuko (BK).

thansal,"So, I want to start a fight.  I really don't like Ippudo.  I think their ramen is about on par (really not as good) with Hide Chan (They both focus on tonkotsu), but it's %50 more expensive ($10 vs $15), and their pork buns are about on par w/ Hide Chan as well (Not Good), and they are about on par price wise with Momofuku's (Excellent).

Everything is about half again as expensive as I want to pay for the quality (if not more), and the crazy wait doesn't help.

My personal favorite is Hide Chan, I love tonkotsu ramen, and their Karage and dumplings are really good.

My recent discovery is Nishida Sho-ten, just a few blocks south of Hide Chan, and good.  Their prices are good at $10 for a bowl, and they often come with more of the extras (Egg, more Kakuni, etc).  Their Kakuni (and they have Kakuni instead of chashu, which is a bit different) can be really excellent.  I've also yet to run into a line there (aka, a good choice if Hide Chan and Toto have lines out the door).  Antoher plus is a nice range of broths (Pork, Chicken, vegie, and some combinations).

The downside is that their quality isn't as reliable.  There's a pretty big range on how well the kakuni has been cooked, and how the broth was.  I'm also not impressed with anything I've seen that wasn't ramen.

I agree with you on momofuku, not worth the extra money, stick to everything else on their menu (Which really is worth the extra money).  Ivan was really interesting, and one of the few fish based ramen shops in NYC that I know of (sadly, I don't like fish...).  I actually think they are pretty traditional iirc.  The only sorta odd thing is the use of Rye noodles.

Ninja addendum: I'm jealous of Seattle and it's abundance of cheap, good Pho.  It's almost as ubiquitous there as cheap pizza is here (and better!)",1421010891.0,/r/FoodNYC/comments/2r97ps/ramen_in_nyc/cnlsw8c/,FoodNYC
