Eowyn27,"So this is an odd story but I went to Ippudo few years ago and I was very disappointed. It was a long wait and I felt the Ramen wasn't that special. I really liked their sake drinks though and apps. I recently went to Ippudo again with a group and it was the BEST Ramen I ever had! Maybe it depends on what you order but I had the Ramen with the burnt garlic and there was so much explosive flavor in there, it was amazing. 

Funnily enough, I tried Ivan's Ramen a few weeks and later, I would have to say, avoid at all costs. Ivan's terribly overrated. 

Go for Ippudo and Totto Ramen is good too!

Momofuku Noodle - Always a solid choice, not the best in the city though.

Zombee_Brett,"Just to give you another opinion on the places being named;

Totally agree with EndiMoon on Ramen-Ya, they have my favorite broth and I love their chashu.

Even though I hear it a lot, I do not think Ippudo is overrated. Good broth and great al dente noodles (I usually get their classic tonkotsu with nitamago egg and shigureni (pulled pork).  Also their pork buns are amazing.  It is expensive and the wait is crazy.  If you go, go before you are hungry, leave your phone number, and find something nearby to do for the up-to-three-hour wait that happens.

Nakamura is a cool tiny spot with great ramen.  Love their Ajitama eggs.

Ivan Ramen is a cool, unique spot with pretty good ramen and a Jewish spin on Japanese food.  The rye noodles are good, and I like a lot of their small non-ramen plates as well.

Totto is very popular, good ramen but not my personal favorite.

Some other spots to consider - 
Ramen Lab is a very tiny, but cool place that hosts ramen chefs from around the world for a few weeks at a time.  Just check the website to see who is there while you are in town.  
For a low key but good place to get a quick bowl, I like Minca Ramen (they also have a sister restaurant Kambi, which I haven't tried.)  
I also like David Chang's Momofuku Noodle Shop, but more for his food other than the ramen.

Also if you plan to travel outside of Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens have some shops worth checking out.

They make their own noodles which is rareish.  They have some amazing special ramens from time to time.  They have a bar.  My recommendation is, go at around 6pm, it's easily worth the hour wait if you stand by the bar and get a bottle of sake and a plate of shishitos.

loudasthesun,"I also used to live in SF, and actually originally from San Jose, where there is an even bigger Vietnamese presence.

First, the good news. There's tons of good ramen in NYC.

Totto's ramen is paitan ramen, made with chicken. If you're looking for tonkotsu soup made with pork bones, you're barking up the wrong tree. I also quite dislike it, so I'm in agreement with you there. Haven't been to Ichiran, but it seems like all the hype is around the solo dining booths, not the ramen itself.

Get your ass to Ippudo. It's virtually at the top of everyone's list of ""good ramen"" and for good measure. Dinner lines are nuts, but lunch is more manageable. 

Other ones in NYC I'd recommend: 

* Hide-Chan in Midtown East

* Mu Ramen in LIC

* Ramen Yebisu in Williamsburg (this one isn't as well known nor does it get as rave reviews, but I personally like it)

* Ramen Lab in Nolita (this is a ""lab"" that hosts a constantly rotating lineup of pop-up ramen restaurants, each one usually from another US or Japanese city, pretty dope concept, but check their site to see who is currently there)

The bad news. Pho, and Vietnamese food in general, is not that great in NYC. My theory is that there just isn't a large Vietnamese community in NYC, and most Vietnamese restaurants are actually run by Chinese-Vietnamese people. You can tell since all the staff speak Cantonese to each other—I rarely hear Vietnamese at these places. You are definitely not finding a Tenderloin (or San Jose) quality bowl of pho for $8. Some pho places that I'm willing to hit up if I do have a pho craving:

* Saigon Shack in the West Village (bit fancier than what you're used to in the TL, $10.95 for the big bowl of pho with ""the works"" cuts of meat)

* Pho Bang and Pho Grand in Chinatown (these two have that grimey hole-in-the-wall feel, if that matters to you)

* Sao Mai in the East Village (has a bigger Vietnamese menu, pho is pretty decent)

* Thai Son - I haven't had the pho here but I've had their other dishes and they were pretty good. Worth checking out their pho, I'd say.

Let me know what you think if you ever hit any of these up. NYC's a great ramen city, but I definitely get my legit pho fix every time I go back to the Bay Area.",1482196026.0,36,/r/AskNYC/comments/5j9y02/where_can_i_get_legit_bowls_of_pho_and_ramen_in/dbekhg3/,AskNYC

caffeine314,"I've lived in Tokyo for over a year and made it a point to going to every famous, and nameless, ramen place I could.  The most legit ramen place I've ever been to in NYC is Hino Maru on Ditmars.

In fact, not only is this place legit, it stacks up *favorably* to almost every single ramen I've had in Japan.  The cha-shu actually comes close to the cha-shu in Japan, which is amazing.  They get the soft boiled egg correct.  And the tonkotsu soup is amazingly authentic ... I swear they make it the old fashioned way by boiling pig bones.  The whole thing would be a _damned_ good ramen even for a hole-in-the-wall place in Tokyo.

For anyone who says Ippudo, please go to Japan.  You have no idea how good ramen can be.  That place is a scourge.  Even the one in Tokyo isn't great.  It's a tourist's place.  The ramen is meh.  The ramen in NYC is meh as well.

Pho Bang in Elmhurst is pretty good, as is District Saigon in Astoria.  District's is piping hot so the temperature is ideal, but it's a bit on the salty side and is a teeny bit more on the pricey side ($12 for the beef bowl).

Pho Bang feels more ""authentic"" but the place is pretty divey/dirty.  Their soup base tastes better but the temperature of the soup is a little off and more on the lukewarm side.

I went to the Jackson Heights location of Thai So on a whim about a month ago, the pho was good but not great.

They even have a chicken & broccoli ""pho"" which I find eyebrow raising. I didn't like the pho so the second (and last) time I went I ordered the vermicelli bowl and there was a broken piece of glass in it.

It's been a while since I went to Sao Mai, so I don't remember the details, but I remember their broth being pretty good, so I probably glossed over the meat factor. At this point I'm just happy with decent broth, and getting tripe/tendon is just a bonus.

I get that not everyone wants tripe, but c'mon, at least put it on the menu. I think this goes back to my theory that there just isn't a big enough Vietnamese population (or pho eaters like me and you) to demand those cuts of meat, or restaurants don't include them in order to make pho more appealing to first-timers.

thansal,"So, I want to start a fight.  I really don't like Ippudo.  I think their ramen is about on par (really not as good) with Hide Chan (They both focus on tonkotsu), but it's %50 more expensive ($10 vs $15), and their pork buns are about on par w/ Hide Chan as well (Not Good), and they are about on par price wise with Momofuku's (Excellent).

Everything is about half again as expensive as I want to pay for the quality (if not more), and the crazy wait doesn't help.

My personal favorite is Hide Chan, I love tonkotsu ramen, and their Karage and dumplings are really good.

My recent discovery is Nishida Sho-ten, just a few blocks south of Hide Chan, and good.  Their prices are good at $10 for a bowl, and they often come with more of the extras (Egg, more Kakuni, etc).  Their Kakuni (and they have Kakuni instead of chashu, which is a bit different) can be really excellent.  I've also yet to run into a line there (aka, a good choice if Hide Chan and Toto have lines out the door).  Antoher plus is a nice range of broths (Pork, Chicken, vegie, and some combinations).

The downside is that their quality isn't as reliable.  There's a pretty big range on how well the kakuni has been cooked, and how the broth was.  I'm also not impressed with anything I've seen that wasn't ramen.

I agree with you on momofuku, not worth the extra money, stick to everything else on their menu (Which really is worth the extra money).  Ivan was really interesting, and one of the few fish based ramen shops in NYC that I know of (sadly, I don't like fish...).  I actually think they are pretty traditional iirc.  The only sorta odd thing is the use of Rye noodles.

Ninja addendum: I'm jealous of Seattle and it's abundance of cheap, good Pho.  It's almost as ubiquitous there as cheap pizza is here (and better!)",1421010891.0,1,/r/FoodNYC/comments/2r97ps/ramen_in_nyc/cnlsw8c/,FoodNYC
